check that you have roughly the correct values in framebuffer address and framebuffer size

-----
in framebuffer)clear.asm

maybe shr rcx, 2 should become shr rcx, 3

-----

check that you are referencing memory address correctly

--------
in heap_init.asm
maybe mov qword [brk_firstlocation], rax should be mov brk_firstlocation, rax

but that is probably illegal

in framebuffer_info.asm

mov rax, [brk_firstlocation] might become mov rax, brk_firstlocation

and mov qword [framebuffer_address], rax might become mov framebuffer_address, rax


-------

check how to debug the signal exit code

--------



--------
check that the memory you are addressing is within the program acceptable area

-----


-----

check the xmdi code for heap allocation, see if there is anything you must include

----



-----

find out whether rsi needs to be incremented by 4

-----

seems to be right

------

find out whether the shr commands are the correct amount
