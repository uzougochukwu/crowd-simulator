heap_init should use framebuffer_info to work out size of the heap needed

framebuffer_clear should also use framebuffer_info to work out how much memory to modify

heap_init and framebuffer_clear shoild never reference each other, otherwise it causes a redundant reference issue



----------
there must be a single trail for a command definition

framebuffer_clear gets info on size of memory to clear from framebuffer_info

heap_init gets the size of heap needed from framebuffer_clear
